ðŸ”¥ First: The 90/20 rule. Work intensely for 90 minutes, then take a FULL 20-minute break. Your brain needs this reset!

ðŸ”¥ Second: Create a dedicated workspace that you ONLY use for work. Your brain will associate this space with focus mode.

ðŸ”¥ Third: End your workday with a shutdown ritual. Write tomorrow's top 3 tasks and physically close your laptop.

Morning routine is EVERYTHING. I prep cold brew the night before + set out my workout clothes.

7AM: Quick 20-min workout instead of scrolling. This single habit changed my ENTIRE day.

8:30AM: Time block my calendar before opening emails. Game-changer!

12PM: Actual lunch break AWAY from my desk. No phone allowed.

3PM energy slump? 10-min walk outside instead of another coffee.

Saved 2+ hours in my day. What part are you struggling with? #ProductivityHacks`
